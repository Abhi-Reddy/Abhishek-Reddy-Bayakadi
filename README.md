### Hi there, I'm Abhishek Reddy

🚀 Aspiring Data Scientist | Quality Engineer at Ecolab | Lifelong Learner

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently working as a Quality Engineer at Ecolab, where I’ve developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. Motivated by a deep interest in data and analytics, I’ve embarked on a journey to transition into the exciting world of Data Science.

To support this career shift, I enrolled in the Executive Diploma in Data Science & AI offered by IIIT Bangalore through the UpGrad platform. This program has equipped me with hands-on experience in Python and essential data science libraries.


🧠 What I'm Learning
* Programming: Python
* Data Manipulation: NumPy, Pandas
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Statistics & Machine Learning: Ongoing exploration

📂 Projects You'll Find Here

This GitHub is a growing collection of my learning journey and practical applications, including:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Visual Storytelling with Python
* Mini Machine Learning Projects (coming soon!)

📈 Goals
* Build a strong portfolio of real-world data science projects
* Contribute to open-source data science initiatives
* Transition into a full-time Data Science role
